The reason to use a pooling layer is that once a specific feature is recognized in the original input volume (there will be a high activation value), its exact location is not as important as its relative location to the other features. Pooling layers can drastically reduce&nbsp;the spatial dimension of the

This serves two main purposes. The first is that the amount of parameters or weights is greatly reduced thus lessening the computation cost. The second is that it will control&nbsp;overfitting. Overfitting refers to when a model is so tuned to the training examples that it is not able to generalize well when applied to live data sets.
